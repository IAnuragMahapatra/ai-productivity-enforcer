A comprehensive set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that transforms Claude into a powerful productivity assistant with persistent memory, project tracking, roadmap management, and customizable personas.

## Overview

This set of MCP servers provides Claude with persistent tools for productivity management, learning tracking, and personalized assistance. Each server maintains its own state and specializes in specific productivity domains.

## Features

### MCP Server Architecture

- **📋 Projects Status Tracker** - Dedicated server for project lifecycle management
- **🗺️ Roadmap Tracker** - Specialized server for structured learning paths and goal progression
- **📊 Productivity Enforcer** - Core server of the system, for daily planning and analytics
- **👤 Profile Manager** - Personal data and preferences server
- **📝 NeetCode Progress Tracker** - Coding practice optimization server
- **🧠 Memory Store** - Persistent key-value storage server
- **📓 Notepad** - Note management server
- **🎭 Prompt Manager** - Persona and system behavior server

### Personas

- **Default Assistant** - Professional productivity-focused assistant with strict accountability and empathetic support
- **😈 Belphie** - A devoted demon assistant persona who calls you "Master" - direct, energetic, and straightforward with a casual but respectful communication style

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Configuration Files

Before running the AI Productivity Enforcer, you **must** customize these example files in the `data/` directory:

```bash
# Copy and edit the required example files
cp example.projects_status.json projects_status.json
cp example.roadmap.json roadmap.json  
cp example.user_data.json user_data.json
```

**Required files to edit:**

- `projects_status.json` - Your actual projects and their current status
- `roadmap.json` - Customize learning roadmap phases and tasks for your subject
- `user_data.json` - Your profile, preferences, and productivity settings

**Note:** Other data files like `productivity_data.json`, `roadmap_tracker.json`, and `memory.json` are auto-generated by the system and don't require manual editing.

### 2. Customize System Prompts

Edit the prompt files in `data/` to match your preferences:

- `system.md` - Main system prompt and behavior
- `belphie.md` - Belphie persona prompt
- Also new persona prompts can be added by adding the md file to `data/` but  `src/mcp_prompt.py` must be modify accordingly.

### 3. Install to Claude Desktop

Run the setup script with administrator privileges:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup-mcp.ps1
```

This script will:

- Install required Python dependencies
- Configure Claude Desktop to connect to all MCP servers
- Set up the complete AI Productivity Enforcer ecosystem

### 4. Start Using

In Claude Desktop, use these commands:

- `/prompt` - Activate the default productivity assistant
- `/belphie` - Switch to the Belphie persona
- The assistant will have access to all MCP servers and persistent data
